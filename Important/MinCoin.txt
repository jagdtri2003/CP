Given a list of coins of distinct denominations and total amount of money. Find the minimum number of coins required to make up that amount. Output -1 if that money cannot be made up using given coins.
You may assume that there are infinite numbers of coins of each type.

Example 1:

Input: arr = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 2*5 + 1 = 11. So taking 2 
denominations of 5 and 1 denomination of  
1, one can make 11.
